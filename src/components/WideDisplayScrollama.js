        Lets look at the characters together<span>&#8212;</span>all of their wins and losses. Its easy to note that <b>Roman</b> is the only one whose <b>wins out number his losses</b>, making him the easiest choice to bet on.

            Before starting work on this visualization, I honestly thought that <b>Tom</b> would win.         </p>
        <p>
        During the third season finale, Tom and Greg seem to be on top. Tom sides with Logan at a critical moment ,when all the kids
         choose not to. Siding with Logan so far has been the move<span>&#8212;</span>he doesnâ€™t lose. 
         But despite this, Tom has so few wins. The show rarely, if ever depicts him successful at work.
        Other than promotions Shiv gets him, we only see him flailing in testimonies and stressed about jail. 
        Along with that, his personal life with Shiv is clearly a disaster.

        Ken is far past redemption, but Shiv maybe can still turn around<span>&#8212;</span>the deal she make with Sandy and Stuey did show she might have competence, but overall its just not enough.

        What shocked me while collecting this data is how few wins there were from actual successes in the business. 
        Either their Jessie Armstrong thinks their personal lives make for better TV or all of them are pretty incompotent.

      <p>
        Either way, I'd just like to know if Tom has made any contribution to the business over the last three seasons...
